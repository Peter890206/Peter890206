Hi, I'm Peter from Tainan, Taiwan. 
I am a master's student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), expecting to graduate around August or September 2024. 

I have a keen interest in deep learning, and my thesis project focuses on using deep learning to track skin features in videos. I am dedicated to deepening my knowledge in areas that interest me and work diligently towards my goals.

I am an optimistic person who values good relationships with my colleagues.
